The BrainCircuits.io platform provides a web-based application to analyze, visualize and query synaptic-level, large-scale connectomics datasets. Please consult the documentation to learn more about datasets, the application and its widgets, or about API access to the data. Currently, the development is mainly driven by the fruitfly EM connectomics community centered around the full adult brain (FAFB) and ventral nerve cord (FANC) datasets.
